i dont know if this stuff will work, but i really wanna make javus has his own custom map (entirely)
ill list the regions i want to add and as well as the iterator concept i want javus to encounter (if i can find how to do it)

ITERATOR CONCEPT:
Name: Four Sudden Regret's
FSR's job (lorewise):
a all-purpose iterator made as a backup if another iterator had to go into a state of sudden repair/lockdown

notes for lore:
each time FSR does the lil rain dump (cycle ender) he feels insanely bad for the creatures, knowing that most get crushed by rain that he made
moreing coming sooning

appearance:
- Inside his can, he is a dark blue
- pink robe
Personality:
Light hearted, sounds like he is burned-out, mournful
for example:
"...can you hear me? are you ok? i thought you would stay up here like me, im not used to animals in my can. is there anything i could do
for you?"

Prologue:
Barren Railway's (DSR):
javus wakes up in a heavily damaged train cart, and a iterator head is etched onto the wall, with a question mark next to it

act 1:
Jarred Communication Array's (JCCA):
whole goal of javus through this region is litteraly just javus entering FSR's walls
Forgotten Fauna (FFAU):
javus walks through a region covered in tree's, never been touched ever since something occured (i can NOT come up with the reason rn)

*CLIMAX ACT 1* Outer Bands (OBAN):
javus is starting to encounter major signs of industrial/mechanical infastructure, and this introduces the major stuff javus will encounter
throughout act 2.

act 2:
Cultured Infastructure (CIFT):
javus is walking through my way of industrial complex (basically just a more rundown industrial)
Trashed Monoliths (TRMO):
im gonna hold your hand when i say this.. (its a more rundown garbage wastes) javus walks through mountains of garbage (ahem like another region rahhh)
FUN FACT*** FSR actually is forced to sort through these rubble of trash to find useful scrap !! (damn i feel bad for this guy)
Close Fortune (CFTU):
javus walks through a open area with large buildings far off

*CLIMAX ACT 2* Clashing Skies (CSHS):
javus is about to enter FSR's leg, this is outer area around the leg

act 3: (one region) FSR's Exterior (FSRE)
Sub Region:
Turning Gears:
basically FSR's leg, javus is starting to go up the leg now
Fateful Underside:
basically the underhang
Arrid Ledge *optional*:
javus is on the final stretch of getting up FSR's superstructure (the wall)
Four Sudden Regrets:
the inside of FSR's Superstructure

then ill think about what iterator man says when i actually get there
